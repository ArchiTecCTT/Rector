# Rector Concerns and Vulnerabilities Register

> Running register for implementation concerns, security risks, review notes, and deferred fixes discovered while implementing chunks. Keep updated through final chunk.

## Open

### Dependency audit reports vulnerabilities

- **Source:** `npm install` / `npm audit` output during branch setup.
- **Severity:** Unknown; npm reported 5 vulnerabilities (4 moderate, 1 critical).
- **Status:** Open.
- **Plan:** Address in a dedicated dependency/security chunk or before public release. Do not run `npm audit fix --force` blindly because it may introduce breaking changes.

### Chat store is in-memory and resets on restart

- **Source:** Chunk 6 worker/reviewer.
- **Severity:** Expected prototype limitation.
- **Status:** Open until MongoDB/local durable store adapter chunk.
- **Plan:** Keep documented. Replace/augment with durable store in later persistence/provider chunks.

### Chat run progress is polling/list only, no SSE/WebSocket

- **Source:** Chunk 6 worker.
- **Severity:** Product UX limitation.
- **Status:** Open.
- **Plan:** Add streaming/SSE in a future chat UX chunk after state/events stabilize.

### Fake orchestrator returns placeholder assistant text

- **Source:** Chunk 6 worker.
- **Severity:** Expected until cognitive modules/provider chunks.
- **Status:** Open.
- **Plan:** Replace with triage/context/planner/DAG/healing flow in chunks 8-15.

### Store list ordering relies on insertion order

- **Source:** Chunk 4 GLM review.
- **Severity:** Low.
- **Status:** Accepted for in-memory prototype.
- **Plan:** Production/durable store should sort explicitly by `createdAt` where UX requires chronological order.

### Store deletes are shallow and do not cascade

- **Source:** Chunk 4 GLM review.
- **Severity:** Low.
- **Status:** Documented in code.
- **Plan:** Production store should define cascade/retention policy explicitly.

### RunEvent IDs require uniqueness across distributed systems

- **Source:** Chunk 5 GLM review.
- **Severity:** Low in local mode, higher in distributed mode.
- **Status:** Mitigated locally with duplicate rejection and random UUID default.
- **Plan:** Production stores must enforce unique event IDs and transaction/conditional-write semantics.

### Security controls are local-process baselines only

- **Source:** Chunk 7 implementation.
- **Severity:** Medium for production deployment.
- **Status:** Open.
- **Plan:** Replace in-memory rate limiting with shared/distributed limiter, add real auth/session enforcement, centralize budget enforcement at provider call boundaries, and harden redaction with structured secret classifiers before public multi-user deployment.

### In-memory rate limiter is local-only and requires distributed backend in production

- **Source:** Chunk 7 review fixes.
- **Severity:** Low for local-MVP, High for multi-instance production.
- **Status:** Mitigated locally via opportunistic expiry cleanup in middleware.
- **Plan:** The current rate limiter uses an in-memory `Map` with opportunistic cleaning of expired buckets on each request. While this prevents unbounded memory growth locally, a production-grade deployment with multiple API instances requires a distributed rate limiter (e.g. Redis, Memcached, or Cloudflare KV/Durable Objects) to enforce rate limits consistently across instances and prevent local `Map` memory overhead under high concurrency.

### Triage and context builder are deterministic placeholders

- **Source:** Chunk 8 implementation.
- **Severity:** Medium product limitation.
- **Status:** Open until planner/provider orchestration chunks replace or augment the baseline.
- **Plan:** Current routing uses local keyword heuristics and placeholder provider/tool/doc/memory inventories. It is safe for the no-provider chat shell, but production routing should add learned/LLM-assisted classification, confidence calibration, workspace-aware tool/provider inventory, and retrieval-backed docs/memory selection.

### Oversized context artifacts are in-memory only

- **Source:** Chunk 8 implementation.
- **Severity:** Low for local-MVP, Medium for longer sessions or restart durability.
- **Status:** Open until durable artifact storage chunk.
- **Plan:** Context packs omit raw oversized content and reference artifact handles, but artifact records are still stored only in `InMemoryRectorStore` metadata and reset on restart. Current in-memory artifacts keep raw oversized content in `artifact.metadata.content`; durable stores must separate blob content from metadata and define retention, access controls, redaction, and encryption before production use.

### Planner is deterministic fake and does not execute or optimize plans

- **Source:** Chunk 9 implementation.
- **Severity:** Medium product limitation.
- **Status:** Open until crucible/DAG/provider chunks replace the fake planner shell.
- **Plan:** Current planner validates schema shape, route-specific task templates, validation coverage, and unsafe approval gates. It does not use LLM reasoning, workspace-aware dependency analysis, real tool availability, or execution DAG compilation yet.

### Skeptic review is heuristic-only

- **Source:** Chunk 10 implementation.
- **Severity:** Medium product limitation.
- **Status:** Open until Crucible/provider-backed review chunks.
- **Plan:** Current skeptic review deterministically checks validation coverage, dangling dependencies, approval gates, empty-task clarification, absent context references, and low-risk underestimates. It does not perform semantic plan critique, real filesystem/API existence checks, exploit analysis, or multi-reviewer consensus yet.

## Closed / Mitigated

### Non-atomic run update then event append

- **Source:** Chunk 5 GLM review.
- **Severity:** Major.
- **Fix:** Added `commitRunTransition` and updated `transitionRun` to use atomic store method. Added regression tests.
- **Status:** Closed for in-memory store; production adapters must implement equivalent atomicity.

### Stale local-MVP docs could mislead agents/contributors

- **Source:** Chunk 0 reviews.
- **Severity:** Major planning risk.
- **Fix:** Added source-of-truth docs/README and stale banners to old docs/specs/implementation-plan files.
- **Status:** Closed.

### Open-source project lacked license/community scaffolding

- **Source:** Chunk 1 scope.
- **Severity:** Release blocker.
- **Fix:** Added Apache-2.0 LICENSE, NOTICE, trademarks, contributing, security, CoC, issue/PR templates.
- **Status:** Closed.
